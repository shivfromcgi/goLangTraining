# Go Language Training - Simplified Architecture

This project demonstrates a simplified, single-file Go application that implements all three assignments from the CGI Go Academy course. The architecture emphasizes simplicity, stateless functions, and direct flag parsing in main.

## Project Structure

```
OpenMedia_GoLang_Course/
├── main.go              # Single-file application with all functionality
├── go.mod               # Go module file with dependencies
├── go.work              # Workspace file for multi-module setup
├── Makefile             # Build and run commands
├── src/pkg/storage/     # Shared storage package (used by Assignment 2)
│   ├── storage.go       # File operations with structured logging
│   └── storage_test.go  # Unit tests for storage package
├── messages.txt         # Generated by Assignment 1 (message storage)
└── README.md           # This file
```

## Usage

### Running Assignment 1 (Message System)
```bash
go run main.go -assignment=assignment1 -user=alice -message="Hello World"
go run main.go -assignment=assignment1 -clear
```

### Running Assignment 2 (Advanced Storage)
```bash
go run main.go -assignment=assignment2
go run main.go -assignment=assignment2 -file=custom.txt -data="My custom content"
```

### Running Assignment 3 (HTTP JSON API)
```bash
go run main.go -assignment=assignment3
go run main.go -assignment=assignment3 -port=9090
```

## Makefile Commands

```bash
make help          # Show all available commands
make build         # Build the application
make assignment1   # Run Assignment 1 with sample data
make assignment2   # Run Assignment 2 with default settings
make assignment3   # Run Assignment 3 (HTTP server)
make test          # Run all tests
make clean         # Clean build artifacts
```

## Architecture Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Avoid unnecessary abstractions and complex patterns
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function has a clear, focused purpose
- **No Premature Abstraction**: Keep things simple until complexity is actually needed
- **Stateless Design**: HTTP handlers and utilities are stateless functions
- **Explicit Configuration**: All startup configuration happens in main() function
